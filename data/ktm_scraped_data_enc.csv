I am the FIRST owner and the bike is very sparingly used, never been dropped, abused, always handled with care and accident free.   Regularly serviced at KTM authorised service centers with an extended warranty intact, AMC membership and insurance paid for.   The kilometers driven is 13k which is extremely low as you can see from the picture attached.   This bike is NOT like every other 390 duke out there and comes with a host of cosmetic modifications and added accessories.  The colour scheme is white & orange but the bike has limited edition KTM powerparts race edition decal wraps which really makes the ride pop out.   - KTM powerparts original tank protector installed.  - KTM powerparts original fuel cap protector installed.   Lastly, I have installed a custom Bosch HID projector lamp set up worth INR nine thousand instead of the stock halogen bulbs that gives great night time visibility while also making this machine fantastic for touring.  Selling as I am relocating. So, if you are passionate about motorcycles and are in the market for a beautiful machine, look no further and do get in touch.   --- The price is slightly negotiable ---  NOTE : Time wasters and low ballers please stay away.

"KTM","Others","2017","18500"," KTM 250 Duke a more comfortable bike to sit on, even for six-foot plus giants. However, while the thicker and wider seat might be marginally more comfortable as far as KTM seats go, it still leaves a lot to be desired. It also gets a bigger 13.5-litre metal fuel tank, which means that using magnetic tank bags is no longer an issue. The MRF Revz tyres on the 250 Duke are ‘H’ rated, and the rubber is a softer compound as compared to the 200 Duke.While riding the 250 Duke, there is never a moment when you cannot feel its vibrations. However, the engine is at its smoothest between 4000rpm and 7000rpm and this is the sweet spot focr highway cruising.
